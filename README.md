# Node.js Mentorship Program

I am a new developer with an engineering background hailing from England. I have focused on predominantly back-end technologies such as C#, Unity 3D, ASP.Net Core/Framework and SQL. As I have worked in large scale enterprise projects for around 2 years, the importance of community as well as Node has become incredibly apparent. At this moment in time I am still doubting my skills and just want to take the opportunity to lay rest to those doubts. It is for these reasons that I wanted to participate in a global community led project and develop my NodeJs skills. 

I hope this was insightful and that the mentee position is suited to me.
